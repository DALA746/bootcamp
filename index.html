        <h2>What is the easiest way to explain Backend?</h2>
        <p>
          The easist way to explain backend is to look at the
          difference between frontend and backend.
          Frontend is what the user sees and interacts
          with in this browser and the backend is what never
          reaches the user's computer but stays on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can define frontend as what the user who opens a webpage
          can and interact with for example texts, images, buttons, forms etc.
          Frontend is even called client-side. Backend on the other hand takes
          the user's interaction and sends it to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend consists of one or several servers, which the browser contacts
          and asks to have the page sent to it. Backend takes care of user data,
          saving files, updating data from a database, sending out email and so on.
